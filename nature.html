		<h1>Landscape photography</h1>
		<h2>Although there are numerous similar flowers, the one I pressed the shutter on was still unique.</h2>
		<p>
			Nature photography is considered by the public
            to be one of the easiest categories of work to produce,
            you just need good equipment as well as perfect time
            planning and the ability to go to the right location
            and you will be able to synthesize a perfect nature
            photograph. But different people's nature photography
            also discloses the mood of the creator and the uniqueness
            of the mind behind that lens. It is because in the age of 
			digital photography, there is no longer any difference 
			between the subject and the reproduction. Photography of 
			landscapes, documentaries, and portraits needs to prove 
			that these images are produced by the "I" as the dominant 
			force. How to naturally leave "dominance" in a photograph 
			becomes the challenge of nature photography today.  
		</p>
        <p>
			I enjoy photographing nature because my memory
            will one day become less clear, and one day I will forget
            details about the mountains or the ocean and the sun. Then
            this is a time when nature photography can always serve
            as a guiding light in the maze of my memory. Nature 
			photography for me is no longer an act of photography 
			that requires a motivation, it more likes playing a 
			game on a computer, but other genres of photography 
			that requires intention is like doing homework on a 
			computer. I can't copy other people's tracks, so I 
			can make the one I captured full of uniqueness.
