		<h1>Nature photography</h1>
		<h2>Intention</h2>
		<p>
			Nature photography is considered by the public
            to be one of the easiest categories of work to produce,
            you just need good equipment as well as perfect time
            planning and the ability to go to the right location
            and you will be able to synthesize a perfect nature
            photograph. But different people's nature photography
            also discloses the mood of the creator and the uniqueness
            of the mind behind that lens.
		</p>
        <p>
			I enjoy photographing nature because my memory
            will one day become less clear, and one day I will forget
            details about the mountains or the oceanor the sun. Then
            this is a time when nature photography can always serve
            as a guiding light in the maze of my memory.
