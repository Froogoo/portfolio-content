			Many congratulations on finding this hidden page,
            an electronic exhibition showing my photography collection,
            I hope you can sense a new world through these images
            and digital pixels. The art of photography is still alive as an object of 
			criticism, but what is more interesting is that it became a social and everyday 
			life act. After the invention of the electronic camera, faster, cheaper 
			and more portable devices were made available to the public, which launched 
			the ambitions and curiosities of everybody. The concept of "photography as 
			neurosis" is more helpful to understand photography in the context of the 
			trend that everyone would like to press the shutter. The act of pressing 
			the shutter is similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. When 
			dealing with a scene, person, or food, the act of pressing the shutter is 
			almost like a semi-automatic response, rather than a thoughtful act that 
			produces a work.

		<p id="mission">
			To collect photographs is to collect the world.
			To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed.
			It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world
			that feels like knowledge and power. A  now notorious first fall 
			into alienation, habituating people to abstract the world into 
			printed words, is supposed to have engendered that surplus of 
			Faustian energy and psychic damage needed to build modern, 
			inorganic societies. This generation of humans seems to be becoming 
			less and less trusting of the brain, and less trusting of the eyes, and 
			instead trusting in the lens and this box of technology, and they believe 
			it is necessary to open the lens cap to archive and digitize the world.

	<aside>
		<p id="aside">I have to admit that photography has liberated the hands of artists.
			But mankind's exploration of the ideal world and the real world has 
			never stopped. What is photography? Is it a record of reality or a 
			depiction of the ideal? Where is the boundary between ideal and 
			reality?
