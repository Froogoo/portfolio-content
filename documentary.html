		<h1>Portraits</h1>
		<h2>"Selfies" took the top spot in the image ranking.</h2>
		<p>
			Portrait photography is a type of documentary, and
            I hope to clearly capture all my interpersonal
            relationships. Although the photograph shows other
            people, the actual story is played out by the
            photographer and the subject. In the era of image poverty, 
			people were afraid of the camera taking their souls, or 
			they were willing to show their faces more to fight for 
			the right to take pictures. Now, with the unrestricted 
			right to image, people can focus on everything and shoot 
			everything, but they are trapped in the difficulty of 
			making the “perfect” portrait.

        <h1>Street Photograph</h1>
		<h2>You are recording the field as an audience in public space.</h2>
		<p>
			It is difficult to have a clear definition of street photography, 
			the images it embodies will change with the times and local 
			culture. For me personally, I feel something on the street 
			that I find interesting, something aesthetically pleasing, 
			something with a coherent theme, and this is what makes me 
			want to press the shutter, or maybe this is Snapshot. 
			Street photography will show how I move and act in
            a space and what I care most about around me. Street
            photography can also be a documentation of small random
            happenings in human history. This kind of photography is 
			really an "extension of my entity", but such an extension makes 
			me return to a more lonely two-dimensional world.
