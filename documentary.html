		<h1>Documentary Photograph</h1>
		<h2>portraits</h2>
		<p>
			Portrait photography is a type of documentary, and
            I hope to clearly capture all my interpersonal
            relationships. Although the photograph shows other
            people, the actual story is played out by the
            photographer and the subject.
		</p>
        <h2>street photograph</h2>
		<p>
			Street photography will show how I move and act in
            a space and what I care most about around me. Street
            photography can also be a documentation of small random
            happenings in human history.
