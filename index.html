			Many congratulations on finding this hidden page,
            an electronic exhibition showing my photography collection,
            I hope you can sense a new world through these images
            and digital pixels.

        <h2>Off Topic</h2>
		<p id="mission">
			To collect photographs is to collect the world.
			To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed.
			It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world
			that feels like knowledge and power. A  now notorious first fall 
			into alienation, habituating people to abstract the world into 
			printed words, is supposed to have engendered that surplus of 
			Faustian energy and psychic damage needed to build modern, 
			inorganic societies.
		</p>
	</main>
	<aside>
		<p>I have to admit that photography has liberated the hands of artists.
			But mankind's exploration of the ideal world and the real world has 
			never stopped. What is photography? Is it a record of reality or a 
			depiction of the ideal? Where is the boundary between ideal and 
			reality?
